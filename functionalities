Potential Funcionalities Updated 6/14/25:
Core functionalities for the app
* User will be able to take a pic of a bottle or can and the app will recognize the type of beer and add it to their account. 
* Some functionality where users can tap repeat or +1 to add another beer they already added that day.
* The app will track overall number of drinks all time and broken down into shorter time periods. It will do the same thing for individual beers.
* There will be location funcionalities where users can track how many beers they have drank in certain locations: bars, their house, friend's houses.
* Users can have friends on the app.
* Leaderboards between friends, cities, countries etc.

Long term more difficult 
* Rating beers - rating beers at certain locations - making posts with pictures of beers and rating and location.
* become a social media
